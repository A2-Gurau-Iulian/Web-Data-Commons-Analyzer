    <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This document presents the software requirements of our implementation
      of the watr project (Web data commons analyzer) which is described as
      a web system which is able to perform various processing tasks on the data provided by <a href="https://webdatacommons.org/">Web Data Commons</a> and is
      aimed as a documentation for easier use and navigation of the app.

      <h3>2.1 Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Web data commons analyzer is an web app that aims to help users to browse, view, graph, classify and match
        data provided by <a href="https://webdatacommons.org/">Web Data Commons</a> in a human readable way, made by team
        Just Web. The project's scope is to deepen our knowledge of modern web
        technologies and web development, with a focus on developing SPARQL endpoints.

      <p>
        This document is made as a requirement for our
        project for the Web Application Development Course and is intended for the
        evaluator teacher to help them navigate our app easier and to get a
        better understanding of the overall architecture of the app.

      <h3>3.1 Product Perspective</h3>
      <p>
        The product represents our version of the watr (Web data commons analyzer) project which represents a mash-up between Netflix, Disney
        and TMDb based on our own SPARQL API and it is designed for interactive
        presentation of data through various means like : tables, graphs, charts and classifications.

      <h3>3.2 Product Functions</h3>
      <p>The main functions of the product are :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the ability to visualize metadata as it is provided by <a href="https://webdatacommons.org/">Web Data Commons</a></li>
        <li>the ability to view various statistics and configurable charts about the data</li>
        <li>the ability to graph the RDF data</li>
        <li>the ability to classify the abstract data and make use of it in a human-readable way</li>
        <li>the ability to export the selected data in JSON-LD and TTL formats</li>

      <h3>3.3 Operating Environment</h3>
      <p>
        This project can operate on a Windows 11 computer with internet
        connection. A Apache Jena Fuseki datastore is needed for the metadata. Also a web browser that
        can support HTML5 and CSS3 is required.

      <h3>3.4 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        The projects represents a web application. The interface was made using React, (TODO FLORIN)
        The backend of the application is made using the Python and the FastAPI framework (TODO FLORIN). We used Apache Jena Fuseki as our RDF datastore.
        In the requirements for implementing this application the choice of frontend and backend frameworks was free.

      <p>
        The website structure consists of 6 pages : Home, Records, Charts, Graph(which are under the visualize section), Classify and Match/Align.
        When the website is accesed the user lands on the home page which gives a brief
        description of the purpose of the website and presents some information about the functionality of
        our app.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the left side of all pages, a navigation bar can be found. Which
        helps the user navigate to the page he or she is interested in. This can be turned off at any time by clicking on the settings icon in the top right corner.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the home page... (TODO : FLORIN)
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the Records page the user can search and filter
        the available datasets based on his or her preferences or interests. The website
        provides filtering by text on the subject, object and predicate properties of the triples and also by dataset and also sorting by these properties.
        In this page there is also the option to export the data in JSON-LD and TTL formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the charts page user can view charts by a few different presets. The types of charts presented are : pie, bar and treemap.
        The charts show the top 15 entries by their respective "by clause" (which can be count for example) and the rest are grouped into a "Other" category, 
        as to not to clutter the chart. Entries visibile on the chart can be turned off and on by clicking on the legend.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the graph page the user can view a graph of the data. They can view graphs of the whole datasets and also they can filter to view graphs 
        that only contain a certain keyword (in their respective subject, predicate and object categories). The graph can be zoomed in and out.

      <h3>4.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
      <p>
        The website interface is responsive so that a user can easily interact
        with it from any device. The communication protocol used is TCP/IP,
        that means that the user requires internet connection to access the
        website.
